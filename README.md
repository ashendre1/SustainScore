About the application=>
We have built an extension that scrapes the data of any e-commerce web application and gives it a rating out of 10 based on the environmental impact. We have accomplished this using the power of large language models

How to run=>

run app.py with the command -> python app.py

run model.py with the command -> uvicorn model:app --reload

open cmd and run the command (after installing ollama and the model) -> ollama run qwen2.5-coder:0.5b

go to extensions on chrome and add the web extension folder that contains (manifest file necessary for extensions)
